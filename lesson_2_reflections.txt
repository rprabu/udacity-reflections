-- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created in the directory git init is run in. Doing this helps us initialize or set the platform for using git power.


-- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a part of Git. It keeps objects that are tracked in the working directory. Files in the staging area are not in the repository yet. It is a temporary place to record/track changes made.


-- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Run a git diff --staged to see change in staged version versus repository version. Compare that with the the working directory version. Depending on these comparisons make a decision of what a logical change unit is and make the commmit accordingly. Note that we do not have a way, via git diff, to compare working directory version and repository version.
